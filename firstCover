Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my interest in the Full Stack Engineer position at your company, as advertised. With a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, over a decade of hands-on development experience, and a passion for learning and adopting new technologies, I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to your team.

In my most recent role as the co-founder and CTO of ForEveryone.ai, I led the development of a web application called PocketPR. This project involved integrating openAI technology to enhance interactions between YouTube content creators and their audience. Utilizing a tech stack that included Clerk, Supabase, Vercel, NextJS, LangChain, OpenAI models, and more, I played a key role in designing the backend infrastructure and implementing robust database management solutions.

To further enhance my skills and stay current with industry trends, I completed a full stack web development Bootcamp at UCLA Extension, where I gained proficiency in technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, node, SQL, MongoDB, and more. I have also actively participated in hackathons, developing applications like Surpay and contributing to projects during Web3 hackathons hosted by Chainlink.

Additionally, my continuous learning journey includes exploring new technologies through Frontend Masters courses, practicing Leetcode questions daily, and hosting local software developer meetups. I am currently expanding my knowledge by learning Golang, writing CLI applications, and receiving mentorship from a senior developer to deepen my understanding of event loops and debugging.

My diverse background as a musician and adjunct music instructor has equipped me with valuable skills such as creativity, discipline, and adaptability, which I apply to my work in software development.

I am confident that my technical expertise, problem-solving abilities, and dedication to continuous learning make me a strong fit for the Full Stack Engineer position at your company. I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to your team and drive the development of innovative solutions.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the possibility of discussing how my skills and experiences align with your team's goals.

Sincerely,
Keegan Anglim
