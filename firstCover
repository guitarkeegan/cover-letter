Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my interest in the position at Solidity Labs as a developer. As the former co-founder and CTO of ForEveryone.ai, I have extensive experience working on web applications and utilizing technologies such as Clerk, Supabase/Postgres, Vercel, NextJS, and OpenAI models. My focus on the backend of projects aligns with the requirements of the role, and I believe my skills and experience would be valuable in helping Solidity Labs build cutting-edge smart contract protocols.

In addition to my practical experience, I have further honed my skills through a full-stack web development Bootcamp at UCLA extension, where I developed numerous projects utilizing technologies like React, Node, SQL, MongoDB, and others. I have also participated in hackathons, including working with Blockchain, Solidity, Hardhat, and NextJS to create innovative solutions. Continuous learning and self-improvement are essential to me, as evidenced by my teaching experience at Cypress College and ongoing education through Frontend Masters. I am excited about the opportunity to bring my diverse skill set and passion for technology to Solidity Labs.

I look forward to the possibility of discussing how my background, skills, and enthusiasms can contribute to the innovative work being done at Solidity Labs. Thank you for considering my application.

Warm Regards,
Keegan Anglim
