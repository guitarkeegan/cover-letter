Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my interest in the Part-Time Engineering, Computer Programming, and Mathematics Teacher/Mentor position at your campus. As the former CTO and co-founder of ForEveryone.ai, I led the development of PocketPR, a web application utilizing openAI technology to connect YouTube content creators with their audience through facilitated conversations. My experience includes working with technologies such as Clerk for user authentication, Vercel for hosting, NextJS as the full stack framework, and utilizing various AI models for chat and embedding features.

In addition to my industry experience, I have completed a Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp at UCLA Extension, where I honed my skills in technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Node, SQL, MongoDB, and more. I have also actively participated in hackathons, where I developed applications like Surpay using Blockchain and Solidity, and contributed to a Web3 hackathon project focused on an E-sports betting platform. Furthermore, my dedication to continuous learning is demonstrated through my current role as an instructor at Cypress College and my ongoing pursuit of new technologies and skills through platforms like Frontend Masters and Leetcode.

I am excited about the opportunity to bring my passion for technology, teaching experience, and commitment to fostering critical thinking to your campus. I am confident that my background in software development and education make me a strong candidate for this role. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,

Keegan Anglim
