Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my interest in the Backend Developer position at UTA. My background in coding and passion for music align perfectly with the responsibilities outlined in the job description. As a Backend Developer, I have experience working with Node.js, MongoDB, and Postgres, and I am confident in my ability to design, develop, and maintain web applications with a focus on speed, scalability, and user experience. Additionally, my familiarity with GraphQL and Algolia will allow me to seamlessly collaborate with front-end development and design teams to optimize web applications.

While my experience aligns well with the requirements of the position, I am also eager to expand my skill set by learning and working with Azure cloud services, IAC, Github actions, Terraform, Kubernetes, and other technologies mentioned in the job description. I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to UTA's projects and bring a fresh perspective to the team. 

Would you like to make any modifications or additions to the cover letter before you submit your application?
